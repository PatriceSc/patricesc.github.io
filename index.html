<h1>Exception handling</h1>
Use a global exception handler showing a generic error message to usees: 
<ul>
  <li>ASP.NET Web Forms:</li>
  <li>ASP.NET MVC 5: </li>
  <li>ASP.NET Core: </li>
</ul>
Make sure exception details are loogged and handed quuickly to developpers:
<ul>
  <li<by default it goes to the event log, you may want to have an alerting system in place for those events</li>
<li>and/or have a logger sending a mail (depending on your expected volume)</li>
  <li<and use an AOM tool such as Azure Application IOnsights, AWS CloudWatch, Elasticsearch APM</li>
</ul>
<div> style="background-color:hsl(0,100%,50%)">
DON'T :
  <ul><li>lof exceptions to a file where they will be forgotten</li>
   <li>hide exceptions using an empty catch block</li>
     <pre>
<heeader>Hide exceptions using an exception</header>
try
{
  // code
}
catch(Exception)
{
}
</pre>
    <li>catch exception locally O?NLY if it clearly brings sme value in addition to telling your users you DO have a problem and to log exception details. In particular it can be counter productive if:
      <ul>
        <li>you end up in confusing users or even yourself about the fact that your app DOES have a problem that needs to be investigated and possibly fixed</li>
        <li>it can make add copmplexity to the code that follows and that needs to be prepared to an unexpected condition. A usual problem is for example turing an exeption into a staus code that is not later checked or to return a null object that your code is not prepared to deal with</li>
      <:/ul>
        IF you have a commpelling reason for that make sure to still log immediately the exception
        </li>
        <li>throw exception as part of your normal control flow. Prefer :
          <ul>
            <li>the TyXXX pattern if you really don"t care about the exception, see DateTime.TryParse, decimal.TryParse
            <li>a validation model such as <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/models/validation?view=aspnetcore-5.0">this</a>, in much earlier version validation was handled through exception but MS moved way from that approach</li>
