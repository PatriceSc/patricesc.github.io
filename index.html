<h1>Exception handling</h1>
Use a global exception handler showing a generic error message to users: 
<ul>
  <li>ASP.NET Web Forms:</li>
  <li>ASP.NET MVC 5: </li>
  <li>ASP.NET Core: </li>
</ul>
Make sure exception details are logged and handed to developpers:
<ul>
  <li>by default it goes to the event log, you may want to have an alerting system in place for those events</li>
  <li>and/or have a logger sending a mail (depending on your expected volume)</li>
  <li>and/or use an APM tool such as Azure Application Insights, AWS CloudWatch, Elasticsearch APM</li>
</ul>
<div style="background-color:hsl(0,100%,50%)">
DON'T :
<ul>
  <li>log exceptions to a file where they will be forgotten</li>
  <li>hide exceptions using an empty catch block
     <pre>try
{
  // code
}
catch(Exception)
{
}
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>catch exception locally <strong>ONLY</strong> if it clearly brings some more value. In particular it can be counter productive if:
      <ul>
        <li>you end up in confusing users or even yourself about the fact that your app DOES not behave as expetted</li>
        <li>if not prepared to this, your app may fail later anyway. A common problem is for example turning an exception into a status code or a null object, but not being prepared for this situation in the code that runs next.</li>
      </ul>
        IF you have a commpelling reason for that make sure to still log immediately the original exception
   </li>
   <li>AVOID to throw exception as part of your normal control flow. Prefer :
      <ul>
         <li>the TyXXX pattern if you really don"t care about the exception, see DateTime.TryParse, decimal.TryParse</li>
         <li>a validation model such as <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/models/validation?view=aspnetcore-5.0">this</a>, in much earlier version validation was handled through exception but MS moved way from that approach</li>
     </ul>
  </li>
</div>
